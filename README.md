##### Background
###### Toward the beginning of World 1-1 in Nintendo’s Super Mario Brothers, Mario must hop over two "half-pyramids" of blocks as he heads toward a flag pole. Below is a screenshot.

##### Specification

###### To make things more interesting, first prompt the user for the half-pyramids' heights, a non-negative integer no greater than ```23```. (The height of the half-pyramids pictured above happens to be ```4```, the width of each half-pyramid ```4```, with an a gap of size ```2``` separating them.)

###### • If the user fails to provide a non-negative integer no greater than ```23```, you should re-prompt for the same again.

###### • Then, generate the desired half-pyramids.

###### • Take care to left-align the bottom-left corner of the left-hand half-pyramid with the left-hand edge of your terminal window.
